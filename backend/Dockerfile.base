# Use lightweight Node Alpine image for smaller image size and faster build
FROM node:20-alpine

# Set working directory inside container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files first for caching
COPY package*.json ./

# Install only production dependencies to keep image lean
RUN npm ci --production

# Explanation:
# - 'npm ci' installs exact versions from package-lock.json
# - '--production' flag avoids installing devDependencies, optimizing image size
